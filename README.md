A collection of React concepts and implementations for learning and experimentation.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. useRef Hook
Implementation and exploration of the `useRef` hook for:
- DOM element references
- Storing mutable values without triggering re-renders
- Accessing previous values
- Focus management and imperative DOM operations

### 2. State Experiments
Various state management patterns and experiments including:
- useState hook variations
- State lifting and sharing between components
- Complex state objects and arrays
- State update patterns and best practices
- Performance optimization with state

### 3. Recoil State Management
Implementation of Facebook's Recoil library for state management:
- Atoms for global state
- Selectors for derived state
- State synchronization across components
- Async data fetching with Recoil
- Performance benefits over Context API

### 4. Custom Hooks
Implementation of reusable custom hooks:

#### useFetch Hook
- Handles API calls and data fetching
- Loading states management
- Error handling
- Cleanup and cancellation
- Reusable across components

#### usePrev Hook
- Tracks previous values of state or props
- Useful for comparisons and animations
- Memory efficient implementation
- Integration with other hooks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
